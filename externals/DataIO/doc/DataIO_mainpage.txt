\section intro_sec Overview of the DataIO Library

DataIO is a library for reading and writing data files that contain simulation
results. Specifically, the library is particularly useful for storing
simulation results obtained from transient
transport simulation programs such as DELPHIN.

DELPHIN is a simulation program for 1D, 2D and 3D heat and mass transport in
porous media. During the simulation the program computes
states in each element, fluxes across element
interfaces and boundaries and other time-dependent quantities.
The output data is typically a subset of the computed information, which may
be further modified by data reduction operations, for example time/spatial
integration and averaging.

The output data and additional meta information are stored efficiently in
DataIO containers. The DataIO library assists developers in
reading/writing such data containers.

An important reference to be read alongside the API documentation is the article:

Vogelsang, S. and Nicolai, A., <b>2011</b>, <i>"Delphin 6 Output File Specification"</i>,
Technical Report, http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa-70337

This page serves as quick-reference and starting point for your own code.

\subsection Key Features
The library was written with large output files in mind, in particular files
with sizes > 500 MB that are created by
2D and 3D simulations. Hence, the library is designed for very fast
reading of files, for both binary and ASCII file formats. When using the
binary format, the library is also tuned to be very memory efficient.
It uses lazy evaluation techniques to provide the data and
initially only scans the files for necessary meta data. Upon first access to
the data of a given time point, this data is parsed/accessed and than
cached for fast access.

\subsubsection lazy_evaluation_concepts Lazy Evaluation Concepts

Lazy-evaluation or rather lazy-reading of output files is an important feature of the DataIO library.
This is mainly necessary for large output files in order to:
- limit memory requirements by selectively reading only data actually accessed by the user,
- speed up reading by delaying string parsing to the time the data is first accessed.

Regarding library functionality, there is a large difference between binary and ASCII data formats.
When reading binary data files, only the header is read, and all time points stored in the data section, but
not the data itself. Thus, the memory needed for reading a binary file is quite small. Later, when data is accessed,
only the data for the selected time index is read from file and stored in the data structure. Hence, the
data structure will gradually grow until the memory limit has been reached.

When reading ASCII files, the whole file is read to memory. However, the lines holding the data are stored as strings and
only the time point values are parsed and placed in the time points vector. Later, when data is accessed, the
corresponding strings are converted into data vectors. Afterwards, the original strings are discarded, hereby freeing
up memory. So, for ASCII files, the memory needed reduces gradually, when more and more data is accessed. The delayed
reading of ASCII files is mainly a feature to speed up reading of ASCII files, not to reduce memory consumption.

\subsection fileformats File Formats

When creating output files with the library, two types of files need to be written:
- data files (extension d6o or d6b)
- geometry files (extension g6a or g6b)

Output files are written either in ASCII or binary format.  Geometry files can also be
written either as ASCII or binary files. This is indicated by
the letter 'o'/'a' or 'b' in the file extension. Reading and writing of binary files is
generally much faster, since string to double conversion routines are not needed.
Also, binary data files allow just-in-time reading of data, which greatly reduces
the memory requirements when working with large output files.

Details of the file format are described in a technical report referenced above in section \ref intro_sec.

\subsubsection olderFormats Support for older File Formats

The library also support reading of DELPHIN 5 output files (*.out), which may
contain geometry data internally.  It is not possible to write Delphin 5 output data.
The library always writes DataIO containers in the most recent format.

\section using Using the DataIO library

\subsection include Include files
All classes, types and functions of the library are embedded in the namespace DATAIO.

The DataIO library has a central include file to use in your code:
\code
#include <DataIO>
\endcode

\subsection importantClasses Important classes

The library is centered around the class DATAIO::DataIO. This class wraps the
content of a data file. The second most
important class is DATAIO::GeoFile, which holds all meta information
related to the simulated geometry.

\subsection typicalUseCases Typical uses for the DataIO library

- reading and accessing data stored in data and geometry files
- creating geometry files
- creating and storing data files

\subsection accessingData Reading data and geometry files and accessing data

\subsubsection readingDataIO Reading DataIO containers

The member function read() can be used to read the complete file
at once. For performance reasons, the file is read quickly in binary mode and
the parsing of the values is done on demand when the function data() is called. The following
example illustrates the principle usage:
\code
DATAIO::DataIO dataFile;
// read file
try {
	IBK::Path dataFilePath("some_file.d6o");
	dataFile.read(dataFilePath);
}
catch (IBK::Exception & ex) {
	// error handling
	ex.writeMsgStackToError();
}
\endcode

\subsubsection readingGeoFile Reading associated geometry files

Each DataIO file stores the relative file path to its geometry file in the header. The following code illustrates
the generation of the file path and reading of the geometry file.

\code
// using the following variables:
//
// dataFilePath - file path to the DataIO file
// dataFile     - DataIO file object, already read from file

DATAIO::GeoFile geoFile;
// read geometry file
try {
	IBK::Path geoFilePath = dataFilePath.parentPath() / dataFile.m_geoFileName;
	geoFile.read(geoFilePath);
}
catch (IBK::Exception & ex) {
	// error handling
	ex.writeMsgStackToError();
}
\endcode

\note A geometry file is typically referenced by several DataIO files. Therefore, it is sufficient to read it only once.

\note For 2D output data (either of type DATAIO::DataIO::T_REFERENCE or holding 2D data points) a geometry file is
not necessary, since x-y plot can be generated with the data alone. In such cases, the member variable m_geoFileName may
be empty.

\subsubsection retrievingData Retrieving data for individual time indexes/time points

Once a DataIO container was read (i.e. parsed for meta information), you can check for the number
of time indexes/time points stored in the file.
\code
// you can access the header data directly through public member variables
std::cout << "Number of time points = " << dataFile.m_timepoints.size() << std::endl;
\endcode

For each time index the associated data array can be accessed using the DATAIO::DataIO::data() member function. This function
returns a pointer to a continuous memory array of size returned by DATAIO::DataIO::nValues().

\code
// data can be requested via the function data().
// for example, access data at time point with time index 10
std::cout << "Retrieving data for time index 10, time = " << dataFile.m_timepoints[10] << " s" << std::endl;
try {
	const double * valdata_t10 = dataFile.data(10);
	// The pointer returned by the data() function is valid as long as the DataIO object
	// is not modified, or moved around in memory.

	// For permanent access even if DataIO object is lost,
	// copy the data into some other memory block:
	// nValues() holds number of points in vector
	unsigned int N = dataFile.nValues();
	std::vector<double> values(valdata_t10, valdata_t10 + N);
}
catch (IBK::Exception & ex) {
	ex.writeMsgStackToError();
}
// to access the last data set, use
const double * lastData = dataFile.data(dataFile.m_timepoints.size() - 1);
\endcode

\subsubsection retrievingDataVector Retrieving vector of first values for all time indexes

For 2D data sets, for each time point only a single value is stored. For convenience, a vector holding
all these values for all time points can be accessed by calling the member function DATAIO::DataIO::dataVector().

\code
const double * values = dataFile.dataVector();
// this vector has the same number of values as there are time points
unsigned int N = dataFile.m_timepoints.size();
\endcode

\subsubsection determiningDataFormat Determining the data format of data stored in DataIO containers

Depending on the selection of elements/sides and the simulation grid, the data represented
by the file may be of different data formats (see DATAIO::DataIO::dataFormat_t). If you have the
geometry file read you can use the member function
DATAIO::DataIO::determineDataFormat() to determine the data format of a specific
DataIO container.

\code
// geoFile  - a geometry file instance holding geometry data
// dataFile - instance of a DataIO container
DATAIO::DataIO::dataFormat_t df = dataFile.determineDataFormat(geoFile);
\endcode

The data format can then be used to switch between different forms of postprocessing operations/diagram options.

\subsubsection generatingPlots Generating 2D/3D plots from data

DataIO containers store many values per time index/time point, whereas the values are mapped to integer numbers stored
as part of the file header. The spatial coordinate of such a value (via its ID number) can only be obtained with the geometry file.
As soon as the geometry file has been parsed all information is present to generate 2D and 3D plots via a suitable plotting
engine (gnuplot, Tecplot etc.).

\todo Add example to create gnuplot files, or use converter as example???

\subsection writingGeometryFiles Creating geometry files
When creating output files containing simulation output from simulated numerical grids, the associated geometry
is needed in post-processing/plotting operations. Since this data is shared among several data files, it is stored
in a separate file, the Geometry file. Before writing DataIO containers the geometry file must be created and a
hash-code of the content of the geometry file must be computed.

\note The use of hash codes allows checking for correct geometry file association to match the data stored in a DataIO
container.

The documentation of the member variables of class DATAIO::GeoFile explains the required data in detail, more theoretical
background can be found in the publication referenced in section \ref intro_sec.
The following code piece demonstrates the basic steps for creating a geometry file.

When writing a geometry file you need to specify all relevant member variables,
as in the example below:
\code
// using vectors materials, elements, sides from your code
// boolean variable use_binary_format also from your code

// create new DATAIO::GeoFile instance
DATAIO::GeoFile geofile;

// *** Populate data tables ***

// compose material data table (the vector materials is from your code)
for (unsigned int i=0; i<materials.size(); ++i) {
	// GeoFile::Material is a class holding all information of a single material definition
	DATAIO::GeoFile::Material mat;
	mat.name  = "some name"; // some descriptive name
	mat.color = IBK::Color::fromHtml("#121212"); // some color, see IBK::Color
	mat.ID    = i; // unique material ID, referenced in elements table below
	// add material definition to list of materials in geofile
	geofile.m_matDefs.push_back(mat);
}

// compose element data table (the vector elements is from your code)
std::vector<double> xWidths;
for (unsigned int i=0; i<elements.size(); ++i) {
	// GeoFile::Element holds all element-specific information
	DATAIO::GeoFile::Element el;
	// specify index of material in MATERIALS table
	el.matnr = 0; // first material in table
	// specify unique element number
	el.n = i;
	// specify grid coordinates (3D grid, coordinate system starting left-bottom-back)
	el.i = i;
	el.j = 0;
	el.k = 0;
	// specify element center coordinates (typically in [m], 3D grid, coordinate system
	// starting left-bottom-back)
	el.x = 0.005 + i*0.01;
	el.y = 0.5;
	el.z = 0.5;
	// append element width to vector (for later use)
	xWidths.push_back(0.01);
	// add element information to vector with elements
	geofile.m_elementsVec.push_back(el);
}

// compose sides data table (vector sides is from your code)
for (unsigned int i=0; i<sides.size(); ++i) {
	// GeoFile::Side holds all side-specific information
	DATAIO::GeoFile::Side sid;
	// specify unique side number
	sid.n = i;
	// specify side orientation
	sid.orientation = DATAIO::GeoFile::X_DIRECTION;
	// specify grid line coordinates (see above)
	sid.i = i;
	sid.j = 0;
	sid.k = 0;
	// specify grid line center coordinates (typically in [m], see above)
	sid.x = i*0.01;
	sid.y = 0.5;
	sid.z = 0.5;
	// add side information to vector with sides
	geofile.m_sidesVec.push_back(sid);
}

// compose grid data, basically all column, row, stack widths
geofile.m_grid.xwidths.swap(xWidths);
geofile.m_grid.ywidths.push_back(1);
geofile.m_grid.zwidths.push_back(1);

// *** Compose file name according to naming convention ***

// Set the string projectContent to some relevant data describing the simulation project,
// at least material references, grid options, everything that determines the content of
// the geometry file.
std::string projectContent  = "input file content or some unique ASCII "
							  "representation of input data that matches this grid";

// compute project file hash code, include IBK_crypt.h for function SuperFastHash().
unsigned int projectFileHashCode = IBK::SuperFastHash(projectContent);
std::string projectFileHash = IBK::val2string<unsigned int>(projectFileHashCode);

IBK::Path projectFilePath("some_project.d6p");
IBK::Path resultsPath("some_project/results");
// projectFilePath and resultsPath (from your code) hold the filename
// of the project file without path and the target directory for the geometry
// file, respectively.

IBK::Path geoFilePath = resultsPath / (projectFilePath.withoutExtension() + "_" + projectFileHash);

// append extension based on binary/ASCII format
if (use_binary_format)		geoFilePath.addExtension("g6b");
else						geoFilePath.addExtension("g6a");

// *** write geometry file ***
try {
	geofile.m_filename = geoFilePath; // set new geometry filename
	geofile.m_isBinary = use_binary_format; // determines binary format writing
	geofile.write();
}
catch (IBK::Exception & ex) {
	ex.writeMsgStackToError();
}
\endcode
In all DataIO containers that are created based on this geometry, the relative file path to the geometry file
and the hash code needs to be set. The hash code is computed as follows:
\code
// compute hash code for writing DataIO containers
unsigned int geofileHash = geofile.hashCode();
\endcode

\subsection writingDataFiles Writing data files
Writing DataIO containers requires setting the header data of the DataIO container, which is mostly the same for
several DataIO files written within the same simulation run.

Afterwards it is possible to write data files in two modes:
1. store complete data and write file at once
2. write only the header and the append data progressively to the file

It is also possible to reopen an existing file and continue appending data to it, a very useful feature when a
simulation is stopped and restarted afterwards, see section \ref reopeningDataFiles.

\subsubsection dataFileHeader Setting header data for DataIO container

Before calling either write() or writeHeader(), you have to specify all relevant information in
the DataIO instance, as in the following example:
\code
DATAIO::DataIO d;
// specify start year, needed to map simulation/output time offsets to actual date/time stamps
d.m_startYear = 2000;
// set the file data type
d.m_type = DATAIO::DataIO::T_FIELD; // used for the keyword ELEMENTS or SIDES and in the header
// store project file name (optional)
d.m_projectFileName = "some_project.d6p";
// store geometry file and hash of the geometry file content
d.m_geoFileName = "some_project_54293221.g6o";
d.m_geoFileHash = 1293211332;
// store quantity information
d.m_quantity = "Thermodynamic Temperature"; // used as axis/series label
d.m_quantityKeyword = "Temperature"; // may be used by post-processing to group series with same type of quantity
// store data and time format
d.m_spaceType = DATAIO::DataIO::ST_SINGLE;
d.m_timeType  = DATAIO::DataIO::TT_NONE;
// store IO units
d.m_timeUnit  = "h";
d.m_valueUnit = "C";
// store number of values and element numbers (or side numbers, if writing fluxes)
d.m_nums = element_numbers; // element_numbers holds as many unique element numbers as values stored per time index
\endcode

Once the data has been stored in the object, it can be written to file.
\code
// finally write the file header
d.writeHeader();
\endcode


\subsubsection writingDataFilesAtOnce Writing data files at once
This is meaningful if the data to be stored is available completely (and fits into memory). In this case, all data
can be set in the DataIO container and be written at once.

As described above, create a DataIO container and first store all header data in the object.

\code
DATAIO::DataIO dataFile;
// ... store complete set of mandatory header data
\endcode

Next, set the data to be stored in the file. You need the time points vector and the
corresponding vector with values. Mind that time points must be in seconds.

\code
// copy data over
dataFile.setData(myTimePointsVector, myValueVector);
// myTimePointsVector is a std::vector<double>
// myValueVector is a std::vector<std::vector<double> >

// or, if original data is no longer needed afterwards, use the more efficient swap() member function of std::vector
dataFile.swapData(myTimePointsVector, myValueVector);
\endcode

Lastly, set filepath and write complete output data to file.
\code
dataFile.m_filename ="/path/to/my/output/file.d6o";
dataFile.m_isBinary = true; // use binary output format
// finally write data to file
dataFile.write();
\endcode

\subsubsection writingDataFilesIncrementally Writing data files incrementally

This is most useful when creating data files while a simulation is running and continuously generating results. Whenever
data for a new output time point has been created, the function appendData() can be called to write this data directly
to file. Note that the data is not stored in the DataIO object, which does not serve as a data container in this case.
Hence, no additional storage memory is needed when calling appendData(). This allows writing of many large output files that
would normally not fit into memory alltogether.

Before calling appendData() the DataIO object has to be initialized correctly with all required header data, see
\ref dataFileHeader.

The following code example illustrates the use of DATAIO::DataIO::appendData():
\code
std::vector<double> outputVector(numValues);
std::vector<DATAIO::DataIO*> dataIOs;
// ...

while (t < t_end) {

	// ...

	if (have_outputs) {
		// process all output files
		for (unsigned int i=0; i<numDataIO; ++i) {
			// generate output data for DataIO container 'i', store/copy output data in vector outputVector
			generateOutputData(i, outputVector);
			// now append data to DataIO file
			dataIOs[i]->appendData(t, &outputVector[0]);
		}
	}

}
\endcode

\subsubsection reopeningDataFiles Reopening data files to continue adding data

DataIO files can be re-opened and more data values can be added. Since header data is already stored in the files,
only the file path is needed, as in the following example:

\code
DATAIO::DataIO dataFile;
try {
	IBK::Path dataFilePath("some_file.d6o");
	dataFile.reopenForWriting(dataFilePath);
	// now the header data members have been read from file and the output stream is positioned at the end of the file

	// suppose you have a vector with data to add
	double tp = 24*3600; // time point to add in seconds
	std::vector<double> dataVec;
	// ... set some data in dataVec

	// ensure size matches
	IBK_ASSERT(dataVec.size() == dataFile.nValues());

	// now add data to file
	dataFile.appendData(tp, &dataVec[0]);
}
catch (IBK::Exception & ex) {
	ex.writeMsgStackToError();
}
\endcode
