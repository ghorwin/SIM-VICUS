  \brief A cubic spline 

  A cubic spline is a spline with C2 continuity at all control points.
  It is a non local spline, what means that all polynomials are changing
  when one control point has changed.

  The implementation is based on the fact, that the continuity condition
  means an equation with 3 unknowns for 3 adjacent points. The equation
  system can be resolved by defining start/end conditions, that allow
  substituting of one of the unknowns for the start/end equations.

  Resolving the equation system is a 2 pass algorithm, requiring more CPU costs
  than all other implemented type of splines.

  \todo The implementation is not numerical stable
