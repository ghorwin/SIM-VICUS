# Building the code

Building the code is fairly easy and only requires two steps:

1. setup the development environment
2. run the build scripts

For actual development we recommend use of Qt Creator with the prepared <<qmake,qmake build system>>.

[TIP]
====
If you are serious with own development of SIM-VICUS/NANDRAD I strongly suggest using Linux and Qt Creator - building the code on Linux is way faster than on Windows/Mac, and code insights and clang analysis in Qt Creator (including refactoring features) are much much better than in Visual Studio and/or XCode. But that's just my humble opinion after a "few" years of working with all of these :-)
====

## Setting up the build environment

Generally, you need a fairly up-to-date C/C++ compiler (that means: `c++11` features should be supported). Also, you need the Qt libraries. And you need cmake. That's it, nothing else!

### Windows

There are build scripts for different VC and Qt versions. To keep things simple, all developers should install the same VC and Qt versions on development machines.

[CAUTION]
====
Team development works best if all use the same compilers and library versions. If you change build scripts and commit them to the repository, always make sure that you do not disrupt other peoples work by requiring alternative installation directories/tool versions.
====

Required versions:

- Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition suffices)
- Qt 15.5.2 

Installation steps:

1. Download and install Visual Studio 2019 Community Online Installer from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16# - Once downloaded, you only need to install basic development options.

+
(Profiling tools are optional, profiling can be done very well with `valgrind` on Linux).


2. Download and install cmake. Either download from https://cmake.org or use _chocolatey_ (https://chocolatey.org) and run

    choco install cmake

3. Download and install Qt Online Installer (https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) and in the installation program select the *5.15.2* variant.

4. Download the VC Qt Tools addin (not really necessary for command line builds, but just in case you want to do development in VC directly - though I wouldn't recommend it): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2019


Also, install a suitable git client (SmartGit is recommendet). Don't forget to specify your git user name and email (user settings).

### Linux

On Linux it's a walk in the park. Just install the build-essential package (g++/clang and cmake and qt5default packages). On Ubuntu simply run:

    > sudo apt install build-essential cmake qt5-default libqt5svg5-dev git qtcreator

Also, install git or a suitable git client (SmartGit is recommendet). Don't forget to specify your git user name and email:

    > git config --global user.name "Your name here"
    > git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

[NOTE]
====
On Ubuntu 18.04 LTS the default Qt version is 5.9.5, so that is the oldest Qt version we are going to support. Whenever deprecated features are used to maintain compatibility with Qt 5.9.5, and where newer Qt features are available in more recent versions of Qt, the use of `#if QT_VERSION >= 0x050a00` (and similar) is possible.
====


### MacOS


[WARNING]
====
HomeBrew does no longer work well for older MacOS versions, such as El Capitan. You may have problems installing certain tools. However, you may still use it to install newer gcc versions, needed for parallel builds.

_Homebrew_ can be used to install other programs (see https://brew.sh). Then

    > brew install cmake

====

On El Capitan (MacOSX 10.11) Qt 5.11.3 is the *last version* to work. So you need to manually download this version. First select the Qt online installer (https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)  and select version 5.11.3. This ensures that all developers use the same Qt version and avoid Qt-specific compilation problems.
    
Parallel gcc OpenMP code require a bit of extra work (to be documented later :-)

Also, install git or a suitable git client (SmartGit is recommendet). Don't forget to specify your git user name and email:

    > git config --global user.name "Your name here"
    > git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"


## Building

This works pretty much the same on all platforms. If you've successfully installed the development environment and can build basic Qt examples (open Qt Creator, pick an example, build it), you should be ok.

Go to the `build/cmake` subdirectory and run:


    > ./build.sh

    
for Linux/MacOS or


    > build_VC2019_x64.bat

or 
    > build_VC2019_x64_with_pause.bat

for Windows.


On Linux/MacOS you can pass a few command line options to adjust the build, for example:


    > ./build.sh 8 release omp


to compile in parallel with 8 CPUs and create a release build (optimized, no debug symbols) with OpenMP enabled. See the documentation in the `build.sh` script for more information.


Once the build has completed, the executables are copied into the `bin/release` (or `bin/release_x64` on Windows) directory.

On Windows, you may want to run `bin/release_x64/CreateDeploy_VC2019.bat` batch file to fetch all required DLLs (so that you can start the application by double-clicking the executables).

[TIP]
====
In case of build problems, inspect the build scripts and the path variables therein. You may need to set some environment variables yourself before running the scripts.
====

[[qmake]]
## Development with Qt Creator

Development is best done with Qt Creator (it is way more efficient to work with than Visual Studio or Emacs/VI). The source code is split into many different libraries and executables, so you best open the prepared session project file `build/Qt/SIM-VICUS.pro`.

If you start working with Qt Creator, please mind the configuration rules described in <<qt_creator>>.


[[vc]]
## Development with Visual Studio on Windows

To avoid the overhead of maintaining yet another build system (so far we have qmake/Qt Creator and cmake), we do not have Visual Studio solutions or project files. However, with the help of cmake you can easily generate VC project files for analysis of the code in Visual Studio.

Open a Visual Studio command line, ensure that `cmake` is in the path and then change into the `SIM-VICUS/build/cmake` directory. There, create a subdirectory, for example `vc`, change into this subdir, and run `cmake`.

Here are the commands when starting from within `SIM-VICUS/build/cmake`:

```batch
:: run from SIM-VICUS\build\cmake

:: load VC compiler path
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"

:: set CMAKE search prefix to find Qt library
set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Qt\5.15.2\msvc2019_64

:: create a subdirectory 'vc' and change into it
mkdir vc
cd vc

:: generate cmake build system files
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ..

```

This generates build system files for Visual Studio 2019 64-bit.

[TIP]
====
If you have a different version of Visual Studio installed, use the respective project file generator as described in https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2016%202019.html[cmake-vc-generators]
====

The command will generate a set of `*.vcproj` files and an `sln` file:

.Minimal selection of Visual Studio components to be installed
image::cmakevsgen.png[]

You can open that and start developing in VC. Just mind that you may need to update your project files whenever new files have been added to the SIM-VICUS source code.

[CAUTION]
====
Even if you've used Visual Studio in the past, we strongly advise against using it for SIM-VICUS development. The learning curve for Qt Creator is short and you will be rewarded with much better refactoring/code analysis features, plus much faster user interface (just try out the code completion!). 

Though, Visual Studio has it's benefits when it comes to specific debugging tasks in the internals of the solver.
