/*! The property widget is located at the right side of the screen.
	Depending on the mode the UI is in, it shows a different set of widgets.
	This class is simply a manager that toggles visibility of the widgets,
	and creates them on first use. The latter helps speed-up the start of the application,
	since less UI widgets need to be created (and less memory is occupied by the user interface).

	When the view is in property edit mode (SVViewState::VM_PropertyEditMode), the embedded
	SVPropModeSelectionWidget is used to toggle/switch between individual mode widgets.
